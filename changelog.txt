Version: 1.1.0
Date: 2021-10-16
  Features:
    - Reworked how the mod initially finds relevant entities to monitor at the beginning of a run,
      improving performance on very large maps.
    - Added a command "/reset-prod-analyst-entities", which you can use if a crafting machine isn't
      being monitored by the mod during a run where it should be. This can happen if a different
      mod created that entity without raising the correspondings scripting event.
    - Changed the mod button style to better fit with other mod buttons.
