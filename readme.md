# Production Analyst

A [Factorio](https://factorio.com) mod that allows you to analyze
the consumption of any item or fluid throughout your factory.

It works by monitoring the various entities that directly consume
the item or fluid for a specified period of time. It's designed to
have minimal UPS impact when a run is in progress and zero UPS
impact when not in use. While it was made with multiplayer in mind,
it has NOT been tested there. It should work well in both vanilla
and modded games.

You can download it from the Factorio
[Mod Portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/production-analyst).
